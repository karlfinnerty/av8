## Overview

av8 is a flight tracking app for Android. The app displays all aircraft within 100 nautical miles (160km) of your current location. It will also display aircraft anywhere in the world if the map is moved to that location. It displays information on each aircraft including airline, type, registration, altitude and speed.  
There are a number of extra features to enhance the map experience including heat maps for speed and altitude and filtering. It is possible to search for any aircraft currently in flight by registration.  
There is also an AR (Augmented Reality) component. This shows all aircraft within 25 nautical miles (nm) of your current location on your camera view, relative to the angle of your phone. av8 is primarily intended for aviation enthusiasts but we have taken measures to simplify various data so it can also be used by more casual users.

## Installation Guide

The av8 app requires an Android device running a minimum operating system of 7.0 (“Nougat”). The app will not work on devices running older versions. The AR component requires that the device supports Google Play Services for AR (ARCore). A list of compatible devices is available here: https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices  
A small minority of devices require a minimum of Android 8.0 or 9.0 to use AR (see above link for details). If your device does not support ARCore, all other app features will still work.  

To install the app, first ensure that installing apps from unknown sources is enabled. It should be possible to find this option in the device settings by searching for it. Otherwise a web search with your device and/or Android OS version should tell you where to find this setting.  
Following this, just download the file *av8.apk* and tap on the downloaded file and select “install” when prompted.  

It is necessary to grant location and camera access to make use of the app’s full functionality (including the AR).
